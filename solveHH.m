This script will solve and simulate the Hodgkin-Huxley equations first 
described in:
HODGKIN AL, HUXLEY AF. A quantitative description of membrane current and 
its application to conduction and excitation in nerve. J Physiol. 1952;117
(4):500-544. doi:10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004764. 

For this project I will compare a self-written Runge-Kutta method of 
numerical integration with Matlab's popular ODE45() function for solving 
ordinary differential equations.

time step by which we are varying by (ms), be aware that
the highest order of magnitude  you should use is 10^-3 (microseconds, 
because base unit is ms here). This is due to an integration problem caused 
by an improper step size. You will get NaN values if you ignore this.

This is the interesting part of the script, lets initialize a runge-kutta
method for numerical integration to solve this ODE, I will be using the
most familiar version of this known as "RK4" method. You can refer to 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rungeâ€“Kutta_methods for a more detailed
explanation.
The output of the hodgkinHuxley equation gives a 4 by 1 column vector such
that dydt = [v, n, m, v] thus kn(1,1) = vn, kn(2,1) = nn, kn(3,1) = mn,
kn(4,1) = hn

for i=1:length(time)-1 % initialize for loop to run through time points
    % fist step of the runge-kutta method, slope at beginning of interval
    k1 = dt*hodgkinHuxley(i,[v(i); n(i); m(i); h(i)]);
    % step 2 of runge-kutta, slope at midpoint of interval
    k2 = dt*hodgkinHuxley((i+(0.5*dt)),[v(i)+(0.5*k1(1,1)); 
        n(i)+(0.5*k1(2,1)); m(i)+(0.5*k1(3,1)); h(i)+(0.5*k1(4,1))]);
    % step 3 of runge-kutta, slope at midpoint of interval
    k3 = dt*hodgkinHuxley(i+(0.5*dt),[v(i)+(0.5*k2(1,1)); 
        n(i)+(0.5*k2(2,1)); m(i)+(0.5*k2(3,1)); h(i)+(0.5*k2(4,1))]);
    % step 4 of runge-kutta, slope at end of interval
    k4 = dt*hodgkinHuxley(i+dt,[v(i)+k3(1,1); n(i)+k3(2,1); m(i)+k3(3,1); 
        h(i)+k3(4,1)]);
    
    % define the next step for each variable v,n,m,h
    v(i+1)= v(i)+(1/6)*(k1(1,1)+2*k2(1,1)+2*k3(1,1)+k4(1,1));
    n(i+1)= n(i)+(1/6)*(k1(2,1)+2*k2(2,1)+2*k3(2,1)+k4(2,1));
    m(i+1)= m(i)+(1/6)*(k1(3,1)+2*k2(3,1)+2*k3(3,1)+k4(3,1));
    h(i+1)= h(i)+(1/6)*(k1(4,1)+2*k2(4,1)+2*k3(4,1)+k4(4,1));
